##Synopsis
This script prevents duplicate entry into the google spreadsheets using google form and notifies the user through email that he is already registered and for new users it will send automatic email that his record has been accepted.

##Motivation 
I was building a website where I required users to fill a form but there was chance that user might fill the form more than once,so the script prevents duplicate entry and also warns the user by sending an email.
